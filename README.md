# SpotifyClone
In this project, I created a spotify interface with html5 & css3.
I used "topbar" and "navbar" in "sidebar", "main container".
I defined "class" in "div" and created playlists then categorized them.
I created a preview section at the bottom of my site. I provided color transition to this section using "linear-gradient".
